## Development Notes

### Key Decisions

1. **Masonry Layout**: Implemented CSS columns for Pinterest-style grid
2. **Infinite Scroll**: Cursor-based pagination for performance
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for likes
4. **Type Safety**: Full tRPC integration for API calls
5. **Authentication**: Supabase for production-ready auth

### Technical Debt

- Temporary date formatting function (replace with date-fns when resolved)
- Report/moderation system not yet implemented
- Advanced search filters not yet implemented
- Date formatting improvements pending (date-fns integration)

### Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Image optimization pending (avatars, card backgrounds)
- Caching strategy for metadata (categories, AI models)
- Infinite scroll implemented for optimal loading performance
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency
- Cursor-based pagination for efficient data fetching
