## Next Phase: Remaining Features

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

- Individual card detail view (`/cards/[id]`)
- User profile pages (`/profile/[username]`)
- Navigation header with user menu
- Comment system UI
- Fork/derivative functionality

### ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications
- Advanced search filters
- User collections
- Card export functionality
- Admin moderation tools
- Performance optimizations

## Development Notes

### Key Decisions

1. **Masonry Layout**: Implemented CSS columns for Pinterest-style grid
2. **Infinite Scroll**: Cursor-based pagination for performance
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for likes
4. **Type Safety**: Full tRPC integration for API calls
5. **Authentication**: Supabase for production-ready auth

### Technical Debt

- ESLint warnings for unsafe database operations (acceptable for prototype)
- Temporary date formatting (replace with date-fns when resolved)
- Missing error boundaries for edge cases

### Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Image optimization pending (avatars, card backgrounds)
- Caching strategy for metadata (categories, AI models)
