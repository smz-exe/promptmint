# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a T3 Stack application for PromptMint - a web app where users can mint, collect, and trade AI prompts as beautiful digital trading cards. The project is built with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and uses Supabase for authentication and database.

**Current Status**: Phase 8 completed - All core features implemented including modern landing page, authentication, full CRUD operations, social features, and advanced search. Project is production-ready.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Stack (T3 Stack)

- **Next.js 15** with App Router (`src/app/` directory)
- **TypeScript** for type safety with strict ESLint configuration
- **tRPC** for type-safe API (`src/server/api/`)
- **Prisma** as ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Supabase** for authentication and database hosting

### Key Directories

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages (landing, feed, auth, card creation, individual cards, profiles)
- `src/components/` - Organized by feature: cards/, feed/, forms/, ui/, layout/, comments/
- `src/server/api/routers/` - tRPC routers for each domain
- `src/lib/` - Utilities including Supabase clients and auth hooks
- `src/trpc/` - tRPC client configuration
- `prisma/` - Database schema, migrations, and seed data
- `docs/` - Project documentation and requirements

### tRPC Router Architecture

Current routers in `src/server/api/routers/`:

- **auth**: User authentication (signUp, signIn, signOut, getCurrentUser)
- **promptCard**: CRUD operations, feed with pagination, search, getForks endpoint
- **like**: Toggle likes, get liked cards, optimistic updates
- **comment**: CRUD for comments with pagination
- **user**: Profile management, user search, favorite cards
- **metadata**: Categories and AI models for forms

Each router includes proper Zod validation and TypeScript types from Prisma.

### Database Schema (Complete)

**Core Models**:

- **User**: Authentication, profile (username, displayName, bio, avatarUrl)
- **PromptCard**: Trading cards with title, description, promptText, rarity system, fork relationships
- **Category**: Programming, Writing, Analysis, Learning, Creative, Others  
- **AIModel**: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Others
- **Like**: User-PromptCard many-to-many with timestamps
- **Comment**: Threaded comments on prompt cards
- **Report**: Content moderation system

**Rarity System**: Automatically calculated from likes (Bronze: 0-19, Silver: 20-49, Gold: 50-99, Platinum: 100+)

### Authentication Flow

- Supabase Auth with email/password
- Auth context provider in `src/lib/auth/context.tsx`
- Protected procedures in tRPC using middleware
- Client and server utilities in `src/lib/supabase/`

### UI Component Architecture

- **shadcn/ui** base components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Feature components**:
  - `PromptCard`: Trading card design with rarity effects and optimistic updates
  - `FeedGrid`: Masonry layout with infinite scroll
  - `FeedFilters`: Category, AI model, and search filtering
  - `PromptCardForm`: Validated form for card creation/editing
  - `RarityBadge`: Visual rarity indicators
  - `ForkButton`: Fork creation with modal dialog
  - `ForkHistory`: Parent/child relationship visualization
  - `ProfileSettings`: User profile editing form
  - `AccountSettings`: Account management and sign out
  - `ErrorBoundary`: Error handling with recovery options

### Data Flow Patterns

- **Infinite Scroll**: Cursor-based pagination with React Query
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for likes before server confirmation
- **Real-time Features**: Like counts update automatically across components
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation matching tRPC schemas

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables (see `.env.example`):

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `DIRECT_URL` - Direct database connection (for migrations)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

## Development Workflow

1. **Database Setup**: Run `./start-database.sh` to start local PostgreSQL
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Database Migration**: `npm run db:generate`
4. **Seed Database**: `npm run db:seed` (adds categories and AI models)
5. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
6. **Code Quality**: Run `npm run check` before committing

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

- **Authentication**: Complete Supabase Auth with sign-up/in/out
- **Database**: Full schema with User, PromptCard, Category, AIModel, Like, Comment, Report
- **API**: All tRPC routers implemented with proper validation
- **UI Components**: Trading card design, feed grid, forms, filters
- **Core Pages**: Landing (`/`), feed (`/feed`), auth (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`), card creation (`/cards/create`)
- **Individual Pages**: Card details (`/cards/[id]`), user profiles (`/profile/[username]`), settings (`/settings`)
- **Feed System**: Masonry layout with infinite scroll, filtering, and search
- **Like System**: Optimistic updates with real-time count synchronization
- **Rarity System**: Automatic calculation and visual indicators
- **Fork System**: Complete fork/derivative functionality with lineage tracking
- **Comment System**: Full CRUD with real-time updates and pagination
- **Settings Management**: Profile editing and account management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and recovery

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production

All core features have been successfully implemented:

- âœ… Advanced search and filtering (date range, rarity, likes)
- âœ… Report/moderation system
- âœ… Date formatting with date-fns integration
- âœ… UX improvements (loading skeletons, breadcrumbs)
- âœ… Modern landing page with 3D effects
- âœ… Authentication flow with proper error handling
- âœ… Responsive design for all screen sizes

### ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)

- Real-time notifications with WebSocket
- Admin dashboard for moderation
- Premium features (advanced analytics, export)
- Mobile app development
- API rate limiting and monitoring

## Code Quality Standards

### ESLint Configuration

- All Prisma type-safety warnings disabled due to generated types
- Strict TypeScript rules enabled
- Consistent import ordering and formatting

### Type Safety Patterns

- Use `Prisma.ModelWhereInput` types for database queries instead of `any`
- Prefer `??` over `||` for null/undefined checks
- Use `void` operator for floating promises
- Import types with `import type` when only used for typing

### Database Patterns

- All database operations use proper Prisma types
- Cursor-based pagination for infinite scroll
- Optimistic updates for real-time features
- Proper foreign key relationships and indexes

### Development Quality Checks

- After completing implementation, always run `npm run check` to verify linting and TypeScript type errors
- After resolving errors, always run `npm run format:check` to ensure proper code formatting
- If formatting issues exist, run `npm run format:write` to automatically correct formatting

Always run `npm run check` before committing to ensure code quality.

### Recent Technical Updates

- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Fixed build errors related to `useSearchParams` requiring Suspense boundaries
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Settings page now uses `force-dynamic` to prevent SSR issues with authentication
- **Type Safety**: All components use proper TypeScript types with no `any` usage
- **Build Optimization**: Successfully building with all routes properly configured
